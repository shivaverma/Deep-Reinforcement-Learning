    "### Learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "I used DQN algorithm for this project since we have discrete action space. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Network acrhitecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Two network were used in this algorithm. One was local and other was target. Architecture for the network is as follows:\n",
    "- Input layer of the network is of size 37 because there are 37 states.\n",
    "- Then there are 2 hidden layers. First one of 24 and second one of size 34.\n",
    "- Output layer size is 4 because there are 4 actions.\n",
    "- Relu activation is used for both hodden layers.\n",
    "- I tried to add dropout also on the layers but it did not seem to have much effect.\n",
    "- So this is how network looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [37]------>[24]------(Relu)------>[34]------(Relu)------>[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "I used following values for the hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- TAU (for soft update of target parameters) = 0.01                \n",
    "- LR (learning rate)= 0.001                \n",
    "- GAMMA (discount factor) = 0.99              \n",
    "- P_DROP (dropout rate) = 0.3              \n",
    "- BATCH_SIZE (minibatch size) = 32           \n",
    "- UPDATE_EVERY (how often to update the network) = 4          \n",
    "- BUFFER_SIZE (replay buffer size) = 10000  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward plot\n",
    "\n",
    "![](reward_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This plot is for 150 episodes. And after 40 episodes later agent receives rewards more then +13 most of the time. \n",
    "- Agnet learned the task pretty quickly. Agent starts to recieve high reward from the 20th episode. I would say it took 40 episode to solve the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideas to improve the performance of the agent in future\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use priority replay buffer. It might help in better performance.\n",
    "- In my network architecture dropout was not putting any effect. So if I change the network architecture then dropout might be useful there.\n",
    "- Adding Batch normalization might also help in better performance.\n",
    "- I tried my best to tune the huperparameters, but still I believe that by further tuning hyperparameters precisly, I can improve the performacnce. Same goes for neural network architecture."
